I feel that glass jars offer the best protection.        However, honey is susceptible to physical and chemical changes during        storage; it tends to darken and lose its aroma and flavor. The recommended        storage temperature for unprocessed honey is below 50°F (10°C). The ideal        temperature for both unprocessed and processed honey is below 32°F (0°C).        Cooler temperatures best preserve the aroma, flavor and color of unprocessed        honey.</p>      <p>Cool temperatures [below 50°F (10°C)] are ideal for preventing crystallization.        Moderate temperatures [50-70°F (10-21°C)] generally encourage crystallization.        Warm temperatures [70-81°F (21-27°C)] discourage crystallization but      degrade the honey.</p>      <p></p></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td><p><strong><a name="Same" id="Same"></a><span class="style7">Is all honey the same?</span></strong></p>          <p>Honey is characterized by color, taste, aroma, moisture content and        degree of processing, for starters.

Unheated, unfiltered      honey is more likely to crystalize than processed honey. Storage of honey      in air-tight, moisture-resistant containers at temperatures below 50°F      (10°C) are ideal to prevent crystalization.</p>    <p>Honey crystallizes      because it is a supersaturated solution. This supersaturated state occurs      because there is so much sugar in honey (more than 70%) relative to the      water content (often less than 20%). Glucose normally tends to precipitate      out of solution and the solution changes to the more stable, saturated      crystaline state.Crystallization      can become a problem when the crystaline honey separates leaving a pool      of liquid honey with a high moisture content. Liquid honey with a high      moisture content is more susceptible to fermentation. Fermentation of honey      is used to produce mead,  one of the world’s oldest fermented beverages.</p>    <p>It      is also possible to induce and control crystallization to produce creamed      honey. This process yields very fine crystals and a smooth product with      a peanut butter-like texture.</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td><p><strong><a name="liquify" id="liquify"></a><span class="style7">How can I make crystalized honey liquid again?</span></strong></p>    <p>Crystallization may be reversed by heating which “melts” the crystals.      Honey can be exposed to  temperatures between 81-104°F (27-40°C)      for  periods of hours; however, heat damage is cumulative so heat exposure      should be limited. Generally speaking, the higher the temperature at which      the honey is kept, the faster the crystals will melt. The balance between      temperature and time is a complex, personal choice the user must make.</p>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td><p><strong><a name="creamed" id="creamed"></a><span class="style7">What            is &quot;creamed honey&quot;?</span></strong></p>      <p>&quot;Creamed honey is one of the finest        hive products available. It has a mild flavor, spreads like butter at        ordinary room temperature, and unlike liquid honey, it doesn’t drip.        Creamed honey is really crystallized or granulated honey. Well-made creamed        honey possesses a creamy texture because the crystallization process        has been precisely controlled. Unfortunately, creamed honey is usually        one of the least promoted products in a beekeeper’s product line. This        situation can be traced, in part, to the fact that most crystallized        honey is produced through a natural or uncontrolled process that usually        results in large, coarse crystals that are hard, difficult to spread,        and not especially palatable. <a href="http://www.masterbeekeeper.org/dyce/creamhoney.htm" target="_blank">Professor        Elton J.
