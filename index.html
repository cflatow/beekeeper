	<p>What is honey?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq_answer_container">
	<div class="faq_answer">
	  <p>Honey is the substance made when the nectar and sweet deposits from plants are gathered, modified and stored by honey bees in their honeycomb. Honey is highly stable against microbial growth because of its low moisture content, low pH, and antimicrobial constituents. Unheated (raw) honey is therefore a safe fresh product as long as these conditions are maintained.</p>

      <div class="faq_question">
	<p>Why is the white stuff on top of my honey?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq_answer_container">
	<div class="faq_answer">
	  <p>Honey is dense. Any white stuff you may find floating on top of your honey when you open the jar is likely to be beeswax that has naturally floated to the top. Unfiltered honey contained particles from the beehive including bits of wax and pollen. Since wax is lighter than the honey it will float to the top. Some people prefer their honey still inside the honeycomb, and chew the wax like gum. I don't currently harvest any honey that way. I give back all the wax comb to the bees to re-use, after spinning the honey out. This saves the bees a lot of work and resources.

      <div class="faq_question">
	<p>Does it matter how I store my honey?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq_answer_container">
	<div class="faq_answer">
	  <p>Honey stored in properly sealed containers can remain stable for decades and even centuries! I feel that glass jars offer the best protection, as plastic is somewhat porous and glass is not. However, honey is susceptible to physical and chemical changes during storage; it tends to darken and lose some aroma and flavor. The recommended long term storage temperature for unprocessed honey is below 50°F (10°C). The ideal temperature for both unprocessed and processed honey is below 32°F (0°C). Cooler temperatures best preserve the aroma, flavor and color of unprocessed honey,

            Cool temperatures [below 50°F (10°C)] are ideal for preventing crystallization. Moderate temperatures [50-70°F (10-21°C)] generally encourage crystallization. Warm temperatures [70-81°F (21-27°C)] discourage crystallization but degrade the honey.

    <!-- Question -->
    <div class="faq">
      <div class="faq_question">
	<p>Is Crystalized honey spoiled?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq_answer_container">
	<div class="faq_answer">
	  <p>Honey is highly stable against microbial growth because of its low water activity, low moisture content, low pH, and antimicrobial constituents. Unheated, unfiltered honey is likely to crystalize much sooner than processed honey. Storage of honey in air-tight, moisture-resistant containers at temperatures below 50°F (10°C) are ideal to prevent crystalization.<br><br>

            Honey crystallizes because it is a supersaturated solution. This supersaturated state occurs because there is so much sugar in honey (more than 80%) relative to the water content (usually less than 20%). Glucose normally tends to precipitate out of solution and the solution changes to the more stable, saturated crystaline state. Crystallization can become a problem when the crystaline honey separates leaving a pool of liquid honey with a higher moisture content. Liquid honey with a high moisture content is more susceptible to fermentation. Fermentation of honey produces mead, one of the world's oldest fermented beverages.<br><br>

            It is also possible to induce and control crystallization to produce creamed honey. This process yields very fine crystals and a smooth product with a peanut butter-like texture.
            <br><br>

            In any case, there is nothing wrong with crystalized honey. In fact, all of my honey will crystalize within a year, and may crystalize much sooner if its temperature is allowed to fluctuate, up and down. Crystalized honey is dripless! </p>

    <!-- Question -->
    <div class="faq">
      <div class="faq_question">
	<p>How can I make crystalized honey liquid again?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq_answer_container">
	<div class="faq_answer">
	  <p>Crystallization may be reversed by heating. Honey can be raised to temperatures up to 110°F (43.4°C) for periods of hours or days; however, heat damage is cumulative so repeatedly overheating it should be avoided. Bear in mind that the while the bees work to keep their brood between 85-97 degrees Fahrenheit during their brood rearing season, temperatures in other parts of the hive where they store extra honey can easily get hotter than 110°F during a sunny summer day. <br><br>

            Generally speaking, the higher the temperature to which the honey is heated, the faster the crystals will liquify. The balance between temperature and time is complex, so this is a personal choice the user must make. You can liquify small quantities of crystalized honey at 85-95°F. I would avoid letting the honey get any hotter than about 110 degrees Fahrenheit to avoid "cooking" it. You can liquify a large jar by keeping the honey at that higher temperature long enough to eventually get it back into liquid state but you're better off liquifying small quantities as you need it. That raises the question that you should answer for yourself. Why do you need to liquify it?</p>

      <div class="faq_question">
	<p>What is "creamed honey"?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq_answer_container">
	<div class="faq_answer">
	  <p>Creamed honey is special honey product. It has a mild flavor, spreads like butter at ordinary room temperature, and unlike liquid honey, it doesn't drip. Creamed honey is a specially crystallized honey. Well-made creamed honey possesses a creamy texture because the crystallization process has been precisely controlled. Most crystallized honey is produced through a natural or uncontrolled process that usually results in larger, coarse crystals.<a href="http://www.masterbeekeeper.org/dyce/creamhoney.htm" target="_blank"> Professor
              Elton J. Dyce, while at Cornell University, learned to control the crystallization
              process and to produce an extremely fine-grained creamed honey.</a></p>

    <div class="faq">
      <div class="faq_question">
	<p>Will the bees be ok if we take their honey?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq_answer_container">
	<div class="faq_answer">
	  <p>What makes honey bees special is their ability to produce and store large quantities of honey so that a substantial colony of workers and their queen can survive through winter. These workers use that honey to generate enough heat to keep the queen at about 95°F no matter how cold it gets outside the hive.<br><br>

            Good beekeeping practices allow beekeepers to manage a hive to produce far more honey than the colony needs to get through the winter and to know how much they can take away while making sure that the bees have enough to do just that.  It is in the beekeepers' interest to maintain strong colonies that survive the winter, if for no other reason than that it is costly to replace them in the spring.</p>

            Because honey is not a free-flowing liquid -- far more dense than water -- a pound of honey, by weight, fills only a 10.67 fluid ounce container. To avoid confusion just remember a pound of honey refers to its weight and not it's volume.</p>

            Drinking tea or warm lemon water mixed with honey is a time-honored way to soothe a sore throat. But honey may be an effective cough suppressant, too.

            In one study, children age 2 and older with upper respiratory tract infections were given up to 2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) of honey at bedtime. The honey seemed to reduce nighttime coughing and improve sleep.

            In fact, in the study, honey appeared to be as effective as a common cough suppressant ingredient, dextromethorphan, in typical over-the-counter doses. ....&quot; <br><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/honey/AN01799"target="_blank"> This story from the MayoClinic.com. </a></p>
